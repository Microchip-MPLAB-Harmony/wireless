    <tr><td class="paramname">xStreamBuffer</td><td>The handle of the stream buffer from which a stream is being received.</td></tr>

    <tr><td class="paramname">xBufferLengthBytes</td><td>The length of the buffer pointed to by the pvRxData parameter. This sets the maximum number of bytes to receive in one call. xStreamBufferReceive will return as many bytes as possible up to a maximum set by xBufferLengthBytes.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="paramname">pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken</td><td>It is possible that a stream buffer will have a task blocked on it waiting for space to become available. Calling xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR() can make space available, and so cause a task that is waiting for space to leave the Blocked state. If calling xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR() causes a task to leave the Blocked state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently executing task (the task that was interrupted), then, internally, xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR() will set *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE. If xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE, then normally a context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. That will ensure the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority Ready state task. *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken should be set to pdFALSE before it is passed into the function. See the code example below for an example.</td></tr>
