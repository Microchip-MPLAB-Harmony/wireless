</pre><p>Interrupt safe version of the API function that sends a stream of bytes to the stream buffer.</p>
<p><em><b>NOTE</b></em>: Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader). It is safe for the writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other FreeRTOS objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or multiple different readers. If there are to be multiple different writers then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function (such as xStreamBufferSend()) inside a critical section and set the send block time to 0. Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function (such as xStreamBufferRead()) inside a critical section and set the receive block time to 0.</p>
<p>Use xStreamBufferSend() to write to a stream buffer from a task. Use xStreamBufferSendFromISR() to write to a stream buffer from an interrupt service routine (ISR).</p>

    <tr><td class="paramname">pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken</td><td>It is possible that a stream buffer will have a task blocked on it waiting for data. Calling xStreamBufferSendFromISR() can make data available, and so cause a task that was waiting for data to leave the Blocked state. If calling xStreamBufferSendFromISR() causes a task to leave the Blocked state, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently executing task (the task that was interrupted), then, internally, xStreamBufferSendFromISR() will set *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE. If xStreamBufferSendFromISR() sets this value to pdTRUE, then normally a context switch should be performed before the interrupt is exited. This will ensure that the interrupt returns directly to the highest priority Ready state task. *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken should be set to pdFALSE before it is passed into the function. See the example code below for an example.</td></tr>
